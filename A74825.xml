            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, my Lord Preſident.</p>
               <p>This is now the third time, that by the great grace and favor of this High Court the Priſoner hath been brought to the Bar before any iſſue joyned in the cauſe. My Lord, I did at the firſt Court exhibite a Charge againſt him, containing the higheſt Treaſon that ever was wrought upon the Theater of England, That a King of England, truſted to keep the Law, that had taken an Oath ſo to do, that had tribute payd him for that end, ſhould be guilty of a wicked deſigne, ſubvert and deſtroy our Laws, and introduce an Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and Tyrannical Government, in the defence of the Parliament and their Authority, ſet up his Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard for War againſt his Parliament and People; and I did humbly pray, in the behalf of the People of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, that he might ſpeedily be required to make an Anſwer to the Charge.</p>
               <p>But my Lord, inſtead of making any anſwer, he did then diſpute the Authority of this High Court; Your Lordſhip was pleaſed to give him a further day to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and to put in his Anſwer, which day being yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:164897:3"/> I did humbly move, that he might be required to give a direct and poſitive Anſwer, either by denying or confeſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

My Lord, Beſides this great delay of Juſtice, I ſhall now humbly move your Lordſhip for ſpeedy Judgment againſt him. My Lord, I might preſs your Lordſhip upon the whole, that according to the known Rules of the Law of the Land, That if a Priſoner ſhall ſtand as contumacious in contempt, and ſhall not put in an iſſuable Plea, guilty or not guilty of the Charge given againſt him, whereby he may come to a fair Tryal; That as by an implicite Confeſſion, it may be taken <hi>pro confeſſo,</hi> as it hath been done to thoſe who have deſerved more favor then the Priſoner at the Bar has done: But beſides, my Lord, I ſhall humbly preſs your Lordſhip upon the whole fact; The Houſe of Commons, the ſupream Authority and Juriſdiction of the Kingdom, they have declared, That it is notorious, That the matter of the Charge is true, as it is in truth (my Lord) as clear as chryſtal, and as the Sun that ſhines at noon day, which if your Lordſhip and the Court be not ſatisfied in, I have notwithſtanding, on the People of Englands behalf, ſeveral witneſſes to produce: And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Sir, You have heard what is moved by the Councel on the behalf of the Kingdom againſt you. Sir, You may well remember, and if you do not, the Court cannot forget what delatory dealings the Court hath found at your hands, you were pleaſed to propound ſome Queſtions, you have had your Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon them. You were told over and over again, That the Court did affirm their own Juriſdiction, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:164897:3"/> it was not for you, nor any other man to diſpute the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the ſupream and higheſt Authority of <hi>England,</hi> from which there is no Appeal, and touching which there muſt be no diſpute; yet you did perſiſt in ſuch carriage, as you gave no manner of obedience, nor did you acknowledg any Authority in them, nor the high Court, that conſtituted this Court of Juſtice.</p>
               <p>Sir, I muſt let you know from the Court, that they are very ſenſible of theſe delays of yours, and that they ought not, being thus authorized by the ſupream Court of <hi>England,</hi> be thus trifled withal, and that they might in Juſtice, if they pleaſed, and according to the Rules of Juſtice, take advantage of theſe delays, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to pronounce Judgment againſt you, yet nevertheles they are pleaſed to give direction; and on their behalfs I do require you, That you make a poſſitive Anſwer unto this Charge that is againſt you Sir, in plain terms, for Juſtice knows no reſpect of perſons; you are to give your poſitive and final Anſwer in plain Engliſh, whether you be guilty or not guilty of theſe Treaſons laid to your Charge.</p>

               <speaker>Lord Preſident.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, You have had the Reſolution of the Court upon the like Queſtion the laſt day, and you were told, that having ſuch Charge of ſo high a Nature againſt you, and your Work was, that you ought to acknowledge the JURISDICTION of the COURT, and to anſwer to your CHARGE. Sir, If you

But Sir I muſt let you know from the Court, as their commands, that you are not to be permitted to iſſue out into any other diſcourſes, till ſuch time as you have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a poſitive anſwer concerning the matter that is charg'd upon you.</p>

               <speaker>The King.</speaker>
               <p>For the Charge, I value it not a ruſh, it is the Liberty of the People of England that I ſtand for; for me to acknowledge a new Court that I never heard of before, I that am your King, that ſhould be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to all the people of England for to uphold Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, to maintain the old Lawes; indeed I do not know how to do it; you ſpoke very well the firſt day that I came here, (on Saturday) of the obligations that I had laid upon me by God, to the maintenance of the Liberties of my People: the ſame Obligation you ſpake of, I do acknowledge to God that I owe to him, and to my People, to defend as much as in me lies the ancient Lawes of the Kingdome, therefore untill that I may know that this is not againſt the fundamentall Lawes of the Kingdome, by your favour I can put in no particular <note n="*" place="margin">This is as the King expreſs'd, but I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed he meant An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</note> Charge: If you will give me time, I will ſhew you my reaſons why I cannot do it, and this—</p>

               <p>By your favour, you ought not to interrupt me; how I came here I know not, ther's no Law for it to make your King your priſoner: I was in a Treaty upon the publique Faith of the Kingdome, that was the known
